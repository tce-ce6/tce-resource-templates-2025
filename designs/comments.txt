Thanks, Satyajit, for taking us through the templates. We are all excited to work on this template. 

I am sharing the points discussed in our meeting:

1) Background and container colour - We plan to change the background and the container design to increase the appeal. We will share a mock screen as discussed.

2) In the Internal and External Organs template, the label text should appear in the answer box (container, but not in the collection)

3) We need the option to resize the image in the container and collection

4) We need the option to rezise the height and width of the container and collection to accomodate images of different sizes

5) The position of the  collection needs to be shown at the bottom for teacher's convenience

6) We need the option to change the line colour and thickness in the 2nd template (labelling)

Thanks,
Srijith
